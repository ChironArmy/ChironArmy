## Hi there, I'm Chiron 👋

## 🎓 About Me

I'm a 23-year-old cybersecurity student currently in my first year at The Open University, embarking on an exciting journey into the world of digital security. My passion lies in understanding how systems work, identifying vulnerabilities, and developing robust solutions to protect against emerging threats in our increasingly connected world.

As a father to three children (two stepchildren and one biological), family is at the heart of everything I do. My motivation to succeed in cybersecurity isn't just personal—it's about building a better future for my family and contributing to a safer digital world for the next generation.

Balancing my studies and family life, I work as a Store Manager at Costa Coffee, where I lead a team and manage daily operations. Before transitioning into management, I spent 3 years as a Physical Security Operative, where I developed a keen eye for identifying threats, assessing risks, and implementing protective measures. This hands-on security experience has given me a unique foundation for understanding cybersecurity—I've seen firsthand how security breaches occur in the physical world, and now I'm learning to prevent them in the digital realm.

My background in physical security has sharpened my leadership abilities, enhanced my problem-solving skills under pressure, and taught me the importance of attention to detail—all qualities that translate perfectly into the cybersecurity field. Managing people and processes in a fast-paced environment has given me a unique perspective on how security principles apply to real-world operations.

## 💭 A Bit More About Me

When I'm not securing systems or managing my store, you might find me exploring new cybersecurity tools, reading about the latest security breaches and how they were executed, or working through CTF challenges. I believe that the best way to learn security is by doing, so I'm constantly hands-on with new technologies and techniques.

Being a young father while pursuing a career change into cybersecurity keeps me grounded and motivated. Every late-night study session and every challenge I overcome is an investment in my family's future. I want my children to see that it's never too late to pursue your passions and that hard work pays off.

I'm passionate about making the digital world a safer place, one line of code and one secure system at a time. The journey from physical security operative to father, barista manager, and aspiring cybersecurity professional is unconventional, but it's given me a unique perspective, incredible resilience, and a diverse skill set that bridges the gap between physical and digital security—a combination I'm excited to bring to the field.
